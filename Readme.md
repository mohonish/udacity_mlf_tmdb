## **Udacity Project #2** - Investigate TMDB Movie Database

The data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

We clean, refine, analyse the db, and generate visualisations, to answer a few questions such as below:

- How has the profitability of movies changed over the years?
- How is the rating on a movie correlated to it's revenue?

### What Did I Use

- Jupyter Notebooks
- Python

### Libraries

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

### **Final Report**
Refer to `Investigate TMDB Movie Database.html` for the final approved project report.
